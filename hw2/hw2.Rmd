20/20. Good job Tom. Keep up the good work. 

Make sure that you have accepted the hw invitation link, and working with your clone repository.

**Due date:** September 28 beginning of class.

**Reminder:** You can insert R code in your Rmd file as a chunk in the following way:
```{r}
# Your code goes here
```
Make sure to insert a chunk for each (sub)section of the assignment.

**Theme of the assignment**: Let's practice visualization using base R and create cool maps. Load in the `Cars93` dataset by running the following code chunk:

```{r}
library(MASS)
data(Cars93)
```

The library function will load and attach add-on packages that have been previously installed on your machine. This will give you access to the functions and datasets available in the package. In general, you only need to install a package once (although it may require updating from time to time) but you need to access it using the library command every time you start a new session in R (and want the functionality). 

The questions below use the `Cars93` data frame as a source of data. This data frame is part of the MASS package and becomes available after loading it. You can get a view of the top of the data frame by using the head command. For more information, type `?Cars93`. Let's load `Cars93` in,
```{r}
head(Cars93)
```

# Base R
## Task 1
a) Create a Frequency table and Relative Frequency table (latter uses percentages) for the variable `Type`. Make sure to round all digits to 3 digits.
```{r}
#frequency table
typeTable = table(Cars93$Type)
typeTable
#relative freq
round(typeTable / nrow(Cars93), 3)
```
b) Create a frequency bar graph for the variable `Type`. You can have count on the y axis.
```{r}
barplot(typeTable, main="Frequencies of Car Types in Cars93", ylab="Frequency", xlab="Type of Car", cex.axis=1.2, cex.names=1.2, cex.lab=1.2, col=1:6)

```

*	Your axes should be labeled and legible
*	The bars should be of different colors
*	The plot should include a title using the main argument
*	The names, labels, and axes sizes (cex parameter) should be set to 1.2

c) Create a pie chart of the variable `Type`.
```{r}
pie(typeTable, main="Types of Cars", col=1:6, cex=1.2)
```

* The plot should include a title using the main argument.
*	The names, labels, and axes sizes (cex parameter) should be set to 1.2

d) What is the mode of the variable `Type`? Comment.
```{r}
#The mode is 22 (of midsize cars)
```


## Task 2 
a) Create a histogram of the variable `Horsepower`.
```{r}
hist(Cars93$Horsepower, col="blue", xlab="Horsepower", ylab="Frequency", cex.lab=1.2, cex.axis=1.2, cex.main=1.2, main="Horsepower of Cars")
```

*	Your axes should be labeled
*	The hist body should have a color (your choice, not too dark to obscure lines) 
*	The plot should include a title using the main argument
*	The names, labels, and axes sizes should be set to 1.2

b) Create a second histogram with breaks at 25 HP increments instead of 50.
```{r}
hist(Cars93$Horsepower, col="blue", xlab="Horsepower", ylab="Frequency", cex.lab=1.2, cex.axis=1.2, cex.main=1.2, main="Horsepower of Cars", breaks=seq(50, 300, 25))
```

* Use the breaks argument to define the classes
* Other setting should be as in part (a)

c) Which histogram more closely follows or rule of thumb for the suggested number of classes? Explain.
```{r}
#The latter histogram more closely follows the rule of thumb.  
#The rule of thumb is that the number of classes should be close to the square root of the number of observations.  
#In this case, there are 93 observations; sqrt(93) = 9.64
#The histogram in part b has 10 classes, which is close to 9.64; the part a histogram only has 5.  
```


## Task 3 
a) What is the type of variable `Passengers`? (Categorical nominal/ordinal or Numerical discrete/continuous?) What happens if we were to make a histogram for `Passengers`? What is the problem with this graph?
```{r}
#'Passengers' is numerical and discrete. 

#print(sort(Cars93$Passengers))
hist(Cars93$Passengers)

#'The problem in the histogram is that it's unclear to the reader what is represented by the bars.  
#'E.g., does the first bar represent cars w/ 2 seats, 3 seats, or both?  Does the second represent 3s, 4s, or both?  
#'In this case, there aren't any 3s in the data set, but it looks like there are some on the histogram since the 2s are in that column.  
#'
#'I.e., a histogram is not appropriate if the classes are the same size as the distances between the data points.  


```

b) Correct the problem in part (a) by creating a more appropriate visualization. Make sure to label your axes, place a title, choose a custom color as in the previous graphs. (Bonus: use factor() with levels option to display x axis values with no observations on the plot.)
```{r}
seats=factor(Cars93$Passengers, order=TRUE, levels=2:8) #convert seats into an ordered factor, with numbers 2,3,4...8 as levels 
barplot(summary(seats), #use summary of the new seats factor as input for barplot
        main="Frequencies of Numbers of Passengers in Cars", col="green",
        cex.axis = 1.2, cex.names=1.2, cex.main=1.2, 
        xlab="Number of Seats in a Car", ylab="Frequency")
```

## Task 4 
a) Make a histogram of the variable `Length` (the default breaks are fine). Other aspects of the plot should be as in part (a) in Task 2.
```{r}
hist(Cars93$Length, main="Car Lengths", xlab="Length (inches)", ylab="Frequency",
     cex.lab=1.2, cex.axis=1.2, cex.main=1.2,
     col="red")
```

b) What is the shape of the distribution?
```{r}
#It is unimodal and roughly symmetrical.  
```


c) Find the mean and median of the variable `Length.` Do these answers meet your expectations from part (b)?
```{r}
print(mean(Cars93$Length)) #mean
print(median(Cars93$Length)) #median

#Yes, it does meet my expectation.  The mean and median are very close to each other, so the graph is roughly symmetrical (i.e., little/no skew).  
#There is a slight skew to the right, since the mean>median, but it is small and to be expected with any data set.  
```

You are done! 🏁 Don't forget to commit and push your .Rmd file to your Github repository before the due date.
